# recipes
This is a TOP Recipes project I will be adding more to it as I learn more.

I was able to use ordered and unordered lists paragraphs headers images and links successfully.
To help with the spacing of the ordered list I looked up and found the < br > element to add spacing to the lists.

I currently have 2 recipes I plan to add at least one more in the future. 

I will be using this repo for the CSS foundations part of TOP
